# CLUSTERING
Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points together based on their features. It helps in discovering underlying patterns or structures in the data. Here are some common clustering algorithms:

1. K-Means Clustering
Description: Partitions data into K distinct clusters based on distance metrics.
Advantages: Simple and fast.
Disadvantages: Requires the number of clusters (K) to be specified beforehand; can converge to local minima.
2. Hierarchical Clustering
Description: Builds a tree-like structure of clusters (dendrogram) through agglomerative or divisive approaches.
Advantages: No need to specify the number of clusters in advance.
Disadvantages: Computationally expensive for large datasets.
3. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
Description: Groups together points that are closely packed, marking points in low-density regions as outliers.
Advantages: Can find arbitrarily shaped clusters and identify outliers.
Disadvantages: Requires tuning of parameters like epsilon (neighborhood size) and minPts (minimum points).
Steps in Clustering Analysis:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalize the data.
Selecting Features: Choose relevant features for clustering.
Choosing a Clustering Algorithm: Based on the nature of the data and the problem at hand.
Model Training: Apply the chosen algorithm to the data.
Evaluation: Assess the clustering results using metrics like silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, or visual inspection.
Interpreting Results: Analyze the clusters to derive insights.
